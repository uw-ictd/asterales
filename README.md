# asterales-hss
A distributed HSS based on sharing of single use auth tokens

# Building

asterales uses containerized build and run environments. To run with a default test
network and a locally built CRDT processor, simply run `docker-compose build` and
`docker-compose up` from the root directory.

## Manually building Dockerfiles

The dockerfiles are kind of a mess right now, since the asterales protocol common "library" is included in multiple
images via copying into each image. This means that the container build context needs to be the root project directory,
not the subdirectories where the dockerfiles for each image lie. The docker-compose file takes care of all this for you,
but if you need build manually you have been warned.

# Things to do:
Track tower identities as entities allowed to submit transactions "on the chain"
Track tower identities as signers for crdt updates
tracker user identities as signers for crdt updates

Track the user's home network
Track the user's 2 months of CRDTs (just need the amt. and UUID, can drop the sigs once validated)
Track the user's finalized balance
Potentially track the user's current balance.

Track the towers' current balances

*** Do I need to keep track of the n^2 who owes who graph with users in the middle? ***
- Can it just be debts between towers?


Figure out exactly what gets sent between two validators when a transaction is communicated


# Running the PBFT Network

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-pbft.yml down -v && docker-compose -f docker-compose-pbft.yml build && docker-compose -f docker-compose-pbft.yml up`
